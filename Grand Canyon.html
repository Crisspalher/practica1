    <p>Grand Canyon National Park, in Northern Arizona,
         en compasses 278 miles (447 km) of the Colorado River and adjacent uplands. Located on ancestral homeland of 11 Associated Tribes, 
         Grand Canyon is one of the most spectacular examples of erosion anywhere 
         in the worldâ€”unmatched in the incomparable vistas it offers visitors from the rims. 
         The South Rim is open. The North Rim is CLOSED for the winter.</p>
